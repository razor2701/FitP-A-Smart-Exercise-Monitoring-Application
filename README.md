# FitP-A-Smart-Exercise-Monitoring-Application

Fitness is the state of human contentment and physical excellence of human body.
In this tedious life, people tend to neglect their fitness and unconcern their health and well being.They have no time to dedicate to their fitness and at times, also cannot afford to join a gym. People who try to exercise at home without the monitoring of a professional trainers are prone to serious injuries over the long run due to anomalies in their posture. To cater this problem, we put forth an idea of a system that monitors the posture of the person who is engaging in a particular exercise. We achieve this by plotting points on all the joints of a person to form a skeleton-like figure. This figure is then used for comparison with the reference frame and the different angles formed between its key points are compared with the angles formed between the reference frame and the confidence score is shown to the user. Any anomaly, if present, is reported to the user. The system will also keep track of the number of repetitions of a particular exercise performed by the user and inform the user about the amount of calories burned during the process. This structure facilitates individuals and bilateral exercise structure. This system is an innovative contribution to the Human Computer Interaction (HCI) domain.
